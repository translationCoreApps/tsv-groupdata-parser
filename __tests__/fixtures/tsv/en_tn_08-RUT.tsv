RUT	front	intro	f68r			0		# Introduction to Ruth<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of Ruth<br><br>1. How Ruth came to Bethlehem with Naomi (1:1–22)<br>1. Boaz helps Ruth as she gleans (2:1–23)<br>1. Boaz and Ruth at the threshing floor (3:1–18)<br>1. How Ruth became the wife of Boaz (4:1–16)<br>1. Obed born to Ruth and Boaz; the genealogy of David (4:13–22)<br><br>### What is the Book of Ruth about?<br><br>This book is about a non-Israelite woman named Ruth. It tells how she came to join the people of Yahweh. The book also explains how Ruth became an ancestor of King David.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>This book traditionally has the title "Ruth" because she is the main person in it. Translators can use a title such as "The Book about Ruth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### When did the events in the Book of Ruth occur?<br><br>The story of Ruth is set during the time when there were "judges" in Israel. These were men and women whom God chose to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. These leaders usually continued to help the people by deciding disputes among them. They also helped them make important decisions. Many of these leaders served all the people of Israel, but some of them may have served only certain tribes.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Why does Scripture include a book about a woman from the foreign land of Moab?<br><br>In a period when Israel was often unfaithful to Yahweh, a woman from Moab shows great faith in him. The Israelites' frequent lack of faith in Yahweh is contrasted with the faith of this woman from a foreign land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])<br><br>### What important marriage custom is found in the Book of Ruth?<br><br>Israelites practiced what is called "levirate marriage." This was a custom for the closest male relative to provide for a childless widow by marrying her. Any children born to them were to be regarded as children of the dead man. They did this so that the dead man would still have descendants. If the closest relative did not marry the woman, another relative could.<br><br>### What was a "kinsman-redeemer"?<br><br>A person's close relative or relatives were expected to act as "kinsmen-redeemers" (2:20 ULT) for him or her. They were responsible to provide for a relative in need. They were also responsible to practice "levirate marriage." In the Book of Ruth, Boaz is one such kinsman-redeemer.<br><br>### What was "gleaning" in the Book of Ruth?<br><br>Poor people were allowed to follow after the men who harvested a field. These "gleaners" picked up sheaves of grain that the harvesters missed or dropped. In this way, poor people were able to find some food. Ruth became a gleaner in a field belonging to Boaz.<br><br>### What is covenant faithfulness or covenant loyalty?<br><br>A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill. Covenant faithfulness or covenant loyalty is when a person does what they said they would do, according to a covenant they had with someone else. God promised that he would love and be faithful to the Israelites. The Israelites were to do the same toward him and toward each other.<br><br>The Book of Ruth shows that what kinsmen-redeemers do for their relatives are part of Israel's duties in God's covenant with them. The story of Boaz, Ruth and Naomi gives good examples to all of Israel of the good effects of covenant faithfulness. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenantfaith]])<br><br>### What function did city gates have in the ancient Near East?<br><br>City gates in the time of Boaz were natural meeting places for the city elders. Elders were honored men who decided business matters and legal matters together. The city walls were large, perhaps two to three meters in width. Therefore the gateway opening provided a shady area for public meetings. For this reason, Boaz and the other elders sat in the gateway.<br><br>Some English Bible versions speak of Boaz sitting "at" the city gate. It may be best for translators to make clear that Boaz sat "in" the city gateway.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How does the Book of Ruth change from one topic to another topic?<br><br>The Book of Ruth often changes to new topics or new parts of the story. The ULT uses various words to indicate these changes, such as "so," "then," and "now." Translators should use the ways most natural in their own languages to signal these changes.<br>
RUT	1	intro	irf4			0		# Ruth 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>### "It happened in the days when the judges ruled"<br>The events of this book occur during the period of Judges. The book is concurrent with the book of Judges. To understand the historical context of the book, the translator may wish to review the book of Judges.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Women without a husband or children<br>In the ancient Near East, if a woman lacked a husband or sons, she was considered to be in a dire circumstance. She would not have been able to provide for herself. This is why Naomi told her daughters to remarry.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Contrast<br>The actions of Ruth the Moabite are intended to contrast with the actions of Naomi the Jew. Ruth shows great faith in Naomi's god, while Naomi does not trust in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])<br>
